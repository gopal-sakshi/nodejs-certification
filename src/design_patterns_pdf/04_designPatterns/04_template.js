// Template
    // to define a family of classes that are all variations of a similar algorithm. 
    // abstract or pure virtual, to use the C++ terminology

/*
    The purpose of Template and Strategy is very similar
    - but the main difference between the two lies in their structure and implementation. 
    - Both allow us to change some parts of an algorithm while reusing the common parts; 
    - however, while Strategy allows us to do it dynamically and possibly at runtime
    - with Template, the complete algorithm is determined the moment the concrete class is defined
