JavaScript
- multi-paradigm
- object-oriented
- prototype-based
- dynamic typing; 
- it treats functions as first class citizens, and allows functional programming styles. 

These characteristics make JavaScript a very versatile language
- which gives tremendous power to the developer
- but at the same time, it causes a fragmentation of programming styles, conventions, techniques


There are so many ways to achieve the same result using JavaScript 
- so, everybody has their own opinion on what the best way is to approach a problem.
- A clear demonstration of this phenomenon is 
    abundance of frameworks and opinionated libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem

Some design patterns we study are 

Factory
Proxy
Decorator
Adapter
Strategy
State
Template
Middleware
Command


Simple patterns such as `Factory` can greatly improve the flexibility of our code
With `Proxy, Decorator, Adapter` we can manipulate, extend, adapt the interface of existing objects. 
`Strategy, State, Template`, instead, have shown us 
- how to split a bigger algorithm into its static and variable parts, 
- allowing us to improve the code reuse and extensibility of our components.
`Middleware pattern`
- process our data using a simple, extensible, elegant paradigm. 
`Command pattern` provided us with a simple abstraction to make any operation more flexible & powerful.
