Pattern (observer)
- defines an object (called subject)
- which can notify a set of observers (or listeners)
- when a change in its state happens.

In observer pattern 
- the subject can actually notify multiple observers

while a traditional continuation-passing style callback will
- usually propagate its result to only one listener, the callback
