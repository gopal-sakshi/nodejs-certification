asynchronous nature 
- and its programming style that makes heavy use of callbacks

its module system
- which allows multiple versions of the same dependency to coexist in an application

observer pattern
- implemented by the EventEmitter class

Node Philosophy
- Small core = the ecosystem of modules living outside the core
- Small modules =  module as a fundamental unit to structure the code
- small surface area
    defining modules is to expose only one piece of functionality such as a function
    while letting more advanced aspects or secondary features become properties of that exported function
        var blah = {}; 
        blah.addNum = function() { }
        blah.subtract = function() { }
        module.exports = blah
- Simplicity

Node solves the <dependency hell> problem
- by making sure that each installed package will have its own separate set of dependencies
- thus enabling a program to depend on a lot of packages without incurring in conflicts

Node <callback conventions>
- Callbacks come last
    fs.readFile(filename, [options], callback)
- Error comes first
    fs.readFile('foo.txt', 'utf8', function(err, data) { ... } )
- Propagating errors
    try catch block must be used within callback function
    try catch block wrapped around callback function ===> will not work


In JavaScript there is absence of namespacing.
- Programs run in the global scope 
    polluting it with data that comes from both internal application code & dependencies is wrong. 
- A popular technique to solve this problem is called <revealing module pattern>


Each module runs in a private scope
- so that every variable that is defined locally does not pollute the global namespace
- `Everything inside a module is a private variable` ---> that isnt explicitly added into module.exports
- Defining globals within a module
    Even if all the variables and functions that are declared in a module are defined in its local scope
    it is still possible to define a global variable
