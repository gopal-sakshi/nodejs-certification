NodeJS shines
    Doing IO operations
    responding to Http request
    talking to a database
    talking to other servers

because NodeJS is single-threaded 
it is possible to handle many requests quickly with low system resource consumption. 
because node only uses a single core of your CPU no matter how many cores you have - it fails @ some tasks.

NodeJS fails
    doing CPU bound operations
    calculating the Fibonacci
    checking if a number is prime or not 
    heavy machine learning stuff
