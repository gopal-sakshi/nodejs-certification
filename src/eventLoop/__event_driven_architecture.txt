Most of Node’s objects — HTTP requests, responses, streams 
- implement the EventEmitter module 
- so they can provide a way to emit and listen to events.



The original way Node handled asynchronous events was with callback. 
- This was a long time ago, before JavaScript had native promises support & async/await feature.
- Callbacks are basically just functions that you pass to other functions.
- This is possible in JavaScript because functions are first class objects.
    just like we pass number, strings as arguments/parameters... we pass functions as parameters to other functions
- It’s important to understand that callbacks do not indicate an asynchronous call in the code. 
    A function can call the callback both synchronously & asynchronously.

EVENT LOOP
a) The event loop is what allows NodeJs to perform non-blocking I/O operations 
— despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded 
— by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.
b) Since most modern kernels are multi-threaded, they can handle multiple operations executing in the background. 
c) When one of these operations completes, 
— the kernel tells NodeJs ----> so that the appropriate callback may be added to the poll queue to eventually be executed.
