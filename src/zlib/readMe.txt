How Compression works
- finding similar strings within a text file
- replacing those strings with a temporary binary representation 
- to make the overall file size smaller


cost (in time & battery usage) of compressing & decompressing data
- should be balanced against the gains in transport efficiency
- (OR) compressing text files under 850 bytes --> extra overhead and is not worth the effort

Summary
- Most image formats (especially JPEGs) do not benefit from compression, but SVG does;
- Most other media formats (e.g. audio, video) do not benefit from compression;
- Very small files (e.g. <1k) generally do not benefit from compression."
