https://nodejs.dev/learn/get-http-request-body-data-using-nodejs


when you initialize the HTTP server using http.createServer()
    the callback is called ----> when the server got all the HTTP headers, but not the request body.
    The request object passed in the connection callback 
        ===> is a stream (or) request object is being transferred via chunks
        ===> meaning, req.on() method gets called everytime a chunk of request object is received
We first get the data by listening to the stream data events
    and when the data ends, the stream end event is called once

    let data = '';
    req.on('data', chunk => { data += chunk;}                   // req.on ---> get executed everytime a new chunk is received
    req.on('end' ()=> {console.log(JSON.parse(data))});         // req.on('end') ---> called when stream is completed
