Routing
- determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, 
    endpoint = URI & specific HTTP request method (GET, POST).
- Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure/SYNTAX:
- app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
    app = instance of express
    METHOD = get, put, delete, post
    PATH = path on the server
    HANDLER = this function is executed when the route is matched.
