some commands I used


npm uninstall node-sass
npm install node-sass@4.0.0


nvm list
nvm install 10.19.0
nvm use 10.19.0
-----------------
node -v 					//10.19.0
ng serve = not recognised command 
npm start 			(I used this instead)


all those earlier errors got lost when I used nvm 10.19.0

earlier errors
- python not found
- node-sass 6.0.0 incompatible with node-sass 4.0.0
	something something
	around 90min (or) 1.5hrs I struggled...
- but when I called yeshwant, he simply asked me to use nvm 10 version and the issue got resolved...

        this.addedProducts.forEach((key, index) => {
          // key[attachment] = {this.prodAttachments[index]}
          this.addedProdWithAttachment[index] = this.addedProducts[index];
          this.addedProdWithAttachment[index].attachment = this.prodAttachments[index];
        })
		
		added this in create-pre-rfq ts file...
		what I noticed = addedProdWithAttachment & addedProducts both are same... both share same memory...
		when I was checking for payload, I got this confirmation...
		even though  I didnt add attachment property to addedProducts array... it got displayed in payload... 
		
	requirementFormForKuber.get('units') I gave... I raised PR, got it merged, deployed... got error... only to realise that it should've been
	requirementFormForKuber.get('unit')
-------------------------------------------

// this was the code for deleting added elements...
this.requirementDetails.removeAt(index);
        this.addedProducts = this.requirementDetails.value;

// I ignored requirementDetails... and processed addedProducts directly...
// but that is a mistake... bcoz, even though u remove in addedProducts, requirementDetails still remain full (not deleted)  & next time all elements get added to addedProducts... think about it...
        this.addedProducts.splice(index,1);
	
	
let element of addedProducts; let index = index
// this is what was originally there... index here correctly outputs as number
// But I changed it to this below... 
let element of addedProducts; let index of index
// now, index shows full product... deleteProd() didnt work as intended...
------------------------------------------

bulk product... cart product... If user adds a bulk product, then he must be given a choice and if he accepts, exisiting regular items in cart will be removed... 
I called this.removeCartItem(product)... but it never worked... 
the control didnt go inside map() operator of that function removeCartItem()

but when other parts of code called removeCartItem(), the control went into map() operator and actually did remove the product from cart... 

I didnt understand why this was happening...

why this.removeCartItem() didnt work when I called it from my function...
why this.removeCartItem() worked when others called it...

for this error, I almost spent 6hrs may be...
I worked on this since friday afternoon in the office... didnt work
okay 3-4pm 1hr - kuber demo by pradeep & vinay...
then 5.30 - 6.30pm - friday activities...
but I stayed till 7, 7.30pm... in the office...
and say for like 30min I helped yeshwant in the asst rfq chat thingy...

then I came home... started work at 8pm till 12midnight... with dinner break, bike round for priya & sahasra... small visit to aditya nilayam...
before sleeping I tried to do it in kuber... 

then I woke up in the morning and tried again... 
out of desperation, last hope... I searched in google, this exact same string
	"control not entering into map method of observable"
	the stackoverflow answer that solved my issue is
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40357753/rxjs-observable-map-not-executing
	
The map is never executed because it creates an observable that stays cold (no subscription). Add an empty subscribe() and it should work.


So, the solution is 


this.removeCartItem(product) 							-----> never works
this.removeCartItem(product).subscribe()		----> 	WORKS
