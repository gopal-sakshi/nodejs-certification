Javascript					
<high level language of abstraction>
- we dont deal with where memory is... 
- JS engine is taking care of all these

C/C++
Assembly language
Machine Language
Micro Processor 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Node JS is written in C++
but node js program is written in javascript
meaning, node itself is C++ program
	meaning V8 is written in C++
	V8 converts javascript code
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
V8
- open source JS Engine
- git clone V8 repo and look into it
	many .cc (C++ file) .h (headers)
	`these .cc files read javascript code and convert into machine code`
- 

V8 can run standalone (or) can be embedded into C++ application
- if u r writing a C++ program, u can put V8 inside C++ program and use it
- we write a C++ program, others write Javascript program 
	you can take that Javascript program put it in our C++ application
	as that javascript runs through V8 engine
