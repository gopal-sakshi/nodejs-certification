Streams
- handle reading/writing files, 
- network communications, or 
- any kind of end-to-end information exchange in an efficient way.


traditional way
- when you tell the program to read a file, the entire file is read into memory, from start to finish, and then you process it.

Using streams
- you read it piece by piece, processing its content without keeping it all in memory.
- you don't need to load large amounts of data in memory before you are able to process it
- less time to start processing data, since you can start processing as soon as you have it, rather than waiting till the whole data payload is available


fs.readFile(...)
    // reads the full contents of file... then something can be done
    // say you want to convert the file (txt to zip (or) mkv to mp4)
    // say the image/video/text file is 1Gb big ====> whole file is read into memory (not good practice)
fs.createReadStream()
    // the 1Gb video is read in parts
