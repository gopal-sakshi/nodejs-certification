create a simple Hello World web server
practice our Jasmine test-writing skills on it.


create an empty Node.js project
(a) mkdir hello_world
(b) cd hello_world
(c) npm init
	as soon as you type this command npm init ----------> then, Angular CLI will ask for some details to populate its package.json file
	details like (name, version, entry point, author, license)
(d) Now, set up two directories in our project’s root directory 
	— one for the server’s source code (app folder)
	— another one for the Jasmine test files. By convention, tests written in Jasmine are called specs (short for specification), and are stored inside the spec directory.
(e) run these commands 
	mkdir app
	mkdir spec


(a) npm install jasmine-node --save
	For writing specifications, test-cases in Jasmine, we need to install its npm package
	Once you install jasmine npm package ---> see package.json file....   automatically, its dependency is added 
	
	"dependencies": {
			"jasmine-node": "^3.0.0"
		}
		
(b) Do this too... dont know why
	npm install request --save
	npm install express --save
	
(c) Our jasmine-node is installed locally in the node_packages directory inside our project’s root directory. 
	To run it, invoke its binary, and point it to our spec folder. 
	./node_packages/.bin/jasmine-node spec
	put this in package.json file... in "test":
	
	for some reason this is throwing error... dont know which of the either is correct
	"test": "jasmine-node spec"
	"test": "./node_packages/.bin/jasmine-node spec"

TEST CASE 1 = we want to test on our server is 
	whether it is returning the HTTP status OK (status code 200) when we send a GET request towards its root path.
